Description: This analysis algorithm employs generalized linear models
    (GLMs) to fit CRISPR screen data, and it analyzes guide-level
    enrichment/depletion using moderated Bayesian statistics and
    quasi-likelihood F tests. Gene-level scores are then calculated and
    compared with a null distribution to calculate enrichment and
    depletion for the screen.
