Description: This analysis algorithm employs generalized linear models
    (GLMs) to fit CRISPR screen data, and it analyzes guide-level
    enrichment/depletion using moderated Bayesian statistics. 
    Gene-level scores are then calculated and compared with a null 
    distribution to determine enrichment and depletion for the screen.
