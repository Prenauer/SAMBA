Description: This analysis algorithm employs generalized linear models (GLMs) to fit CRISPR 
    screen data, and it analyzes guide-level enrichment/depletion using moderated Bayesian 
    statistics and quasi-likelihood F tests. Gene-level scores are then calculated and compared 
    with a null distribution to calculate enrichment and depletion for the screen.
